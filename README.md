INTRODUCTION

Predticting solubility my running machine learning models with the help of chemprop
It is based on the workflow provided by HASTEN, which helps in boosting virtual screening workflows. 

DESCRIPTION:
It will select 10K compounds randomly from the entire dataset 

DATASET: collection of 7 cured datasets (AqSOL, AQUA, ESOL, CHEMBL, KINECT, OCHEM, PHYS) retrieved from
